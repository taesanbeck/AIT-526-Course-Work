    "Problem to be Solved:\n",
    "This is a program that simulates a conversation with a psychotherapist, specifically an implementation of the classic ELIZA chatbot. The program listens for certain key phrases and responds based on those phrases. The goal is to create an illusion of understanding, even though the chatbot simply uses pattern matching and substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Input:\n",
    "User: I am feeling a bit sad today\n",
    "Program: Did you come to me because you are feeling a bit sad today?\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "1. Initialize a set of response rules in the form of regular expressions, along with corresponding responses.\n",
    "2. Initialize a reflection dictionary to swap pronouns in the user's input to reflect the statement back to them.\n",
    "3. Precompile the response rules regular expressions for efficiency.\n",
    "4. Begin the conversation by asking for the user's name.\n",
    "5. In a loop, accept user input and match it with the response rules.\n",
    "6. If a match is found, select a random response from the corresponding responses, reflect the matched group from the user's input, and replace placeholders in the response with the reflected group.\n",
    "7. If no match is found, respond with a default message.\n",
    "8. If the user indicates they want to end the conversation, print a goodbye message and exit the loop.\n",
