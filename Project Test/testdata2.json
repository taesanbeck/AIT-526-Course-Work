I have played and beaten this game about 10 times. It's help kids learn about different types of plants which ones are safe to eat and which ones are deadly. You can geather, fish and hunt.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are amazing very fine and sharp which doesn't happen with most games.\n\nSound: The sound if wonderful although it sometimes is a little slow, but other then that it's really good.\n\nPros: Help ppl learn about different plants, fish and wild game.\nIs really fun to play and it never gets old.\nHas really cool short movies that you can watch over and over again.\n\nCons: For some reason the rattle snakes always try to kill me.\nCan sometimes be a little tricky but if you bye the right stuff you will be fine.\nThe disc got scratched up pretty easyly from just being in the Cd rom.\n\nOverall it's a good game that is good for ages 6 and up.",

So add this line to your systems host file - static3.cdn.ubi.com 87.248.207.150 - and it should connect.  Also be aware of uplay, they updated it once and the game wouldn't work.  There is a way around updates though just disconnect from the internet and start the game then when the log in screen comes up connect to the internet again and you should be good.  Hopefully, ubisoft doesn't read this and change the format cause I really love this game.",
