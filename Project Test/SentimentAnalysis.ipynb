So add this line to your systems host file - static3.cdn.ubi.com 87.248.207.150 - and it should connect.  Also be aware of uplay, they updated it once and the game wouldn't work.  There is a way around updates though just disconnect from the internet and start the game then when the log in screen comes up connect to the internet again and you should be good.
